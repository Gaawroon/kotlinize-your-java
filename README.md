# KotlinizeYourJava

###### KotlinizeYourJava is not yet another boring tutorial. 
## KotlinizeYourJava is an interactive set of challenges for Java developers (from interns till principals) who wants to master Kotlin's coolest features.
It is a set of practical exercises + solutions, brought to you by experienced Kotlin engineers and backed by relevant pieces of official docs.


### Why?
Kotlin is a general purpose programming language developed by JetBrains with full Java interoparability. As its popularity grows, it becomes a frequent choice for Java developers who wants to make their code cleaner and more reliable.

For Java developers, it's relatively easy to shift to Kotlin. What is more, JetBrain's IDE - IntelliJ - have a native "Java to Kotlin converter" feature that takes your code written in Java and makes a compilable Kotlin code out of it. Such convertion is as easy as copy-pasting code between `.java` and `.kt` files.

This is where the problem begins. Pure convertion from Java to Kotlin does not make your code better. It is usage of Kotlin features that makes your code cleaner.

Believe me. I have seen too many projects written in KotJava - code with Kotlin syntax but Java style.

In most cases, it is not developers' fault. There is no many resources focused on easing the shift from Java to Kotlin. Sure, you can go through the docs, but it's not only time-consuming, but also rarely gives you first-hand, battle-tested examples of prettifying your code with Kotlin sugar. Until you learn the coolest features and see them in real life, it is hard to come up with best practices on your own.

### What this repo is not
- This is not the best starting point if you never touched any JVM code.
- Neither it is if you never touched any code.
- You won't learn basics of Kotlin syntax here.
- Not every single feature of Kotlin is covered by these exercises.
- 

### Why you will love this challenges?
- You will take your hypothetical Java code and transform it to Kotlin - not only by making it compilable, but also by properly using Kotlin features
- Real-life examples of useful Kotlin features will not only get you familiar with, but will also be your source of inspiration for the most common cases with best efforts-to-benefits ratio.
